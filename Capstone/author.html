          <p>In 1991, Suzanne Collins began her career as a writer for children's television shows She worked on several shows
            for Nickelodeon, including
            <i>Clarissa Explains It All, The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo, Little Bear,</i> and
            <i>Oswald.</i> She was also the head writer for Scholastic Entertainment's
            <i>Clifford's Puppy Days.</i> She received a Writers Guild of America nomination in animation for co-writing the
            critically acclaimed Christmas special,
            <i>Santa, Baby!</i>
          </p>

          <p>After meeting children's author James Proimos while working on the Kids' WB show
            <i>Generation O!</i>, Collins felt inspired to write children's books herself. Her inspiration for
            <i>Gregor the Overlander</i>, the first book of The New York Times best-selling series
            <i>The Underland Chronicles</i>, came from
            <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, when she was thinking about how one was more likely to fall down a manhole than a rabbit
            hole in New York City, and would find something other than a tea party.</p>

          <p>Between 2003 and 2007 she wrote the five books of the
            <i>Underland Chronicles: Gregor the Overlander, Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane, Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods,
              Gregor and the Marks of Secret,</i> and
            <i>Gregor and the Code of Claw.</i> During that time, Collins also wrote a rhyming picture book,
            <i>When Charlie McButton Lost Power</i>, illustrated by Mike Lester.</p>

          <p>In September 2008, Scholastic Press released
            <i>The Hunger Games</i>, the first book of a trilogy by Collins.
            <i>The Hunger Games</i> was partly inspired by the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. Another inspiration was
            her father's career in the Air Force, which gave her insight to poverty, starvation, and the effects of war.
            The trilogy's second book,
            <i>Catching Fire</i>, was released in September 2009, and its third book,
            <i>Mockingjay</i>, was released on August 24, 2010.</p>

          <p>Within 14 months, 1.5 million copies of the first two
            <i>Hunger Games</i> books were printed in North America alone.
            <i>The Hunger Games</i> was on The New York Times Best Seller list for more than 60 weeks in a row. Lions Gate Entertainment
            acquired worldwide distribution rights to a film adaptation of
            <i>The Hunger Games</i>, and Collins adapted the novel for film herself. The subsequent two novels were adapted
            into films as well, with the latter book split into two cinematic installments, for a total of four films representing
            the three books.</p>

          <p>As a result of the popularity of
            <i>The Hunger Games</i> books, Collins was named one of Time magazine's most influential people of 2010. In March
            2012, Amazon announced that she had become the best-selling Kindle author of all time. Amazon also revealed that
            Collins had written 29 of the 100 most highlighted passages in Kindle ebooks—and on a separate Amazon list of
            recently highlighted passages, she had written 17 of the top 20.</p>

          <p>On 17 June 2019, Collins announced that the prequel to the
            <i>Hunger Games</i> would be released on May 19, 2020. The premise is based on the failed rebellion 74 years before
            <i>The Hunger Games trilogy.</i> On October 4, 2019 the title was revealed to be
            <i>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.</i>
          </p>

          <p>Her books have sold over 100 million copies worldwide.</p>
