        <h3>Medium Article</h3>
      </div>

      <p>The problems on this site were numerous: poor layout, drab color choices, enourmous misuse of white-space, and in general just bad design. The whole site was set up in a 3 coulmn layout, with 2 persistant sidebars, the left of which changed based on the page to hold either a tiny bit of text, of images that belonged in the main section. The right sidebar never changed and holds reviews for the author's books.</p>
      <p>The only option that I could see for this site was a complete overhaul from the ground up.</p>
      <p>I started with a background image for the header based off of cover art for the first 2 books in the Hunger Games series. I blended them together, then removed the dark areas and set a gradient background across the whole body that transitions subtley from one color tone to another, tying the 2 artworks together further.</p>
      <p>I then added a fixed, scaling Heading and Subheading, Navigation at the top, and a fixed position, scaling, pixel-density responsive logo that helps to bridge between the header and the main content of the page.</p>
      <p>For the pages, I tried to keep them mostly similar categories to what the original site had, though I renamed the "Interview" tab to be Blog, with the intent of making it a placeholder for an actual blog to be developed later. I nested the actual Interview page as a faux blog post in a submenu.</p>
      <p>The home page I turning into a "Coming Soon" landing page, though I did add the responsive slider at the bottom, as per the directions. To be honest, I probably would not have the slider on this page in a real project, though it could easily become the basis for a gallery page.</p>
      <p>For the Books page, I made sections for the different types of books she has written, and made info cards with the covers, the reviews she had in the sidebar, and a hover animation the overlays the cover with a short blurb about each particular book.</p>
      <p>The About The Author page is a basic bio with a wrapped picture of the author that is responsive.</p>
      <p>The faux blog post is where I decided to use the lazy-loading gallery, though I made it into a lazy loading background image gallery behind the post. The taller the post, the more images are allowed to show, and they only load when you scroll to them. I couldn't think of a better place to put in this requirement without making a whole new media gallery page.</p>
      <p>Finally we have a basic Contact page, with a responsive, if basic, form that takes you to a thank you page on submission.</p>
      <p>The most challenging part of this particular assignment was making the header, the header background, and the logo all move and scale together to keep consitency across multiple device widths. I learned a lot about scaling text that I didn't know before, as well as nesting positioning and starting with assests that are properly sized.</p>
      <p>Working with this different color pallete also presented some challenges, but I think that it turned out well and I enjoyed it.</p>
