                remains of what used be North America. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated.
                As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual
                televised event called, "The Hunger Games." The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change
                but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. When her sister is chosen by lottery, Katniss steps up to go

                on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow
                of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.</div>
